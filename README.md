# Rust network coding library
This is a generic network coding library. This library provides abstractions for
window-based error correcting codes. This currently works with Random Linear Codes (RLC, patented by MIT) and Vandermonde Linear Codes (based on the [Tetrys FEC Scheme](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9407.html).
Other error correcting codes can be added in the future.
